<p>At one of the <a href=http://www.operacabal.com/hydeparksalons> Hyde
Park Salons</a>, I saw Jonathan Marks' presentation on anamorphic
art.  He had morphed images so that they only looked correct when
reflected in a mirrored cylinder.  He morphed his images by hand.  I
was interested in trying out some morphed images, but didn't have the
patience or artistic skill to do it by hand, so I made a python script
to do it for me.  I'm posting it in case anyone else wants to try it
out.</p>

<p>Here's the file: <a href = anamorphic.py> anamorphic.py</a>.  To
run it, after you download it, go to the command line, change your directory to the folder
containing the file, and type "python anamorphic.py".  The gui should guide
you through the steps to morph an image, and save the results. If you don't have python,
<a href = http://www.enthought.com/products/epd.php> Enthought </a>
has a easy-to-install distribution free to academics, and there are
also lots of online tutorials on how to install python. The script
only takes .png files, so please use some other software to convert
your images to .pngs. Contact me (e l m at m i t dot e d u) if you're having trouble.
