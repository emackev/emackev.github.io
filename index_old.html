<p>I'm a graduate student in <a href = http://mit.edu>MIT</a>'s <a href = http://bcs.mit.edu/>Brain and Cognitive
Sciences</a> department.  I work in <a href = http://web.mit.edu/feelab/>Michale Fee's lab</a>, studying how
zebra finches learn to sing. How does the brain learn complex behaviors?  Does it break them into simpler pieces?  How are goals represented, and translated into actions that produce those goals?  Songbirds learn to imitate the songs of tutors they heard as juveniles.  From unstructured babbling, repeatable syllables emerge.   My work focuses on how the brain of a young bird learns to produce each new syllable.  My neural recordings and modeling work suggest a simple mechanism by which timing learned in one domain (listening to a tutor) could be transferred to support learning in a new domain (singing).   </p>

<h2>helpful course websites</h2>
<p>Computational neuroscience is a fascinating and expanding
subject. Over the past few years, I've been involved in teaching several computational neuroscience
courses, including designing new curricula.  Links to relevant materials (and websites for a couple of my
other favorite courses) are below: </p>

<p> I founded a series of tutorials on computational topics related to
brain and cognitive sciences, including
Bayesian methods, learning in recurrent netorks, learning in deep
networks, and decoding.  References
and exercises are posted <a
href=https://stellar.mit.edu/S/project/bcs-comp-tut/index.html>
here</a>.  Videos of the tutorials are <a

Methods in Computational Neuroscience, a summer course at Woods Hole
which I TAed 2013-2015, has materials <a

here</a>. </p>

<p> The  <a
href=http://cbmm.mit.edu/>
Center for Brains, Minds and Machines</a> summer course at Woods Hole
has materials <a

here</a>, including my lecture on <a

Neuroscience Perspective</a>. </p>

Intro to Neural Computation (9.40)</a>, a course I TAed in 2015 and 2014
(its first year as a requirement for all Brain and Cognitive Sciences
undergrads at MIT).</p>

<p>Statistical learning theory and applications (taught by Tomaso Poggio)
has helpful slides and lecture notes on the theory and algorithms
involved in machine learning on its <a href =
http://www.mit.edu/~9.520/>website</a>. </p>

<p>How to make (almost) anything's <a href=http://fab.cba.mit.edu/classes/863.12/>
website</a> provides detailed practical
advice on making (almost) anything (course taught by Neil Gershenfeld).  It's also fun just to look through what people
made each week.  Here's <a href=http://fab.cba.mit.edu/classes/863.12/people/mackevicius/index.html>my page</a> documenting each of my weekly
projects.  </p>

their partnership with <a href =
